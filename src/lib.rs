//!
//! Fastcoin is a Rust library aiming to provide a complete access to REST APIs for various
//! crypto-currencies exchanges. All methods consume HTTPS api. This library is not intendeed to
//! stream data (you should use websocket/FIX in that case)..
//!
//! Currently only Poloniex is supported but other exchanges will be added soon.
//!
//! ### Exchange support:
//! - [x] Poloniex
//! - [x] Kraken
//!
//! # WARNING
//! This library is highly experimental at the moment. Please do not invest what you
//! can't afford to loose.
